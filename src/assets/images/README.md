# How It Works - Image Assets

This folder contains the images used in the "How It Works" section of the landing page.

To update the images, simply replace the files in this folder while keeping the filenames exactly the same:
- `step1.jpg` -> Corresponds to "Take a photo"
- `step2.jpg` -> Corresponds to "Visualize instantly"
- `step3.jpg` -> Corresponds to "Hire a pro"

If you add new images with different names, you will need to update `src/components/landing/HowItWorks.tsx` to import them.
